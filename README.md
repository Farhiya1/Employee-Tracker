# Employee-Tracker

# Why did I build this project?

Building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This content managment system would allow for non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in the database.

This application will also give me the opportunity and experience to build and develop my skills using node js, mysql and inquirer.

# What have I achieved so far?

1. I have met all the acceptance criterias below

# Why I would like to add in the future?

1. I would like to try and add some additional functionality to my application, such as the ability to do the following:

- Update employee managers.

- View employees by manager.

- View employees by department.

- Delete departments, roles, and employees.

- View the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
